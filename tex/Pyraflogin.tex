\section{Pyraflogin.py}

The file \dhl{$HOME/iraf/pyraflogin.py} has a 'kitchen sink' collection of
extensions to PyRAF. It defines a few tasks and adds a set of functions
to use matplotlib within pyraf sessions. It adds a few routines to make
moving between sexigesimal and decimal representations. It might even
type to \dhl{SQLite3} at some point. In short, it adds things to PyRAF
for pipelines and to let you really dig into your data.

It is part of the \dhl{github/.../smtsci} repository.

\subsection{Plotting}

There is no doubt a better way to handle this...

Two global variables are declared:

\begingroup \fontsize{10pt}{10pt}
\selectfont
%%\begin{Verbatim} [commandchars=\\\{\}]
\begin{verbatim} 
try:
   from   mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from   matplotlib import cm
except exception:
   print("Could not find python matplotlib parts we wanted. Running under anaconda?")


_fig     = None  # manage an internal figure, reset with our_figure
_ax      = None

def our_figure():
   """Resset our global fig and ax instances. This allows overplotting."""
   global _fig,_ax
   _fig     = plt.figure(1,clear=True)
   _ax      = plt.axes()

# our_figure

\end{verbatim}
\endgroup
%% \end{Verbatim}

that perform their usual roles.

\Prose{Ohellium-i is in emission and I smell a Nobel!}:

But, Wait! splot tells me the x column for this line is 123-133.
So:

\begingroup \fontsize{10pt}{10pt}
\selectfont
%%\begin{Verbatim} [commandchars=\\\{\}]
\begin{verbatim} 
impoort glob
files = glob.glob('oh*fits')
rawcube = []
for fname in files:
   with fits.open('dark.fits') as f:
      d = f[0].data
      h = f[0].header 
      rawcube.append(d[122:133,:)
cube = np.array(rawcube)
rawcube = []           # del is overloaded, so keep symbol, just empty.
newfits('darkcube.fits',cube,h)      # make ds9 viewable cube!
our_figure()
mean = cube(axis=0)    # mean into the x,y face
diff = mean - mean.mean()
our_surface(diff)      # surface plot
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup
%% \end{Verbatim}

And,,, drat. There is a stuck pixel making that line stand above the others.



\subsection{Making a special file for ds9.}

So,,, here I am in a quandry with dark.fits and I want to see places
on that image where the pixel values are 3 standard deviations above
the mean. Some cheap sensors have issues in this regard.

We did \dhl{from astropy.io import fits}, so

\begingroup \fontsize{10pt}{10pt}
\selectfont
%%\begin{Verbatim} [commandchars=\\\{\}]
\begin{verbatim} 
with fits.open('dark.fits') as f:
   d = f[0].data
   h = f[0].header 
newd = np.zeros_like(d)
newd[d >> d.mean() + d.std() * 3.0] = 1.0
newfits('meandark.fits',newd,h) # et Viola! ones in the bad places.
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup
%% \end{Verbatim}
