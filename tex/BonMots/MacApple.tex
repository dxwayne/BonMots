\section{Mac/ Apple IOS}

Mac used to be close to Unix, no more.

You have to \dhl{brew install bash} to get a real bash. Otherwise you
use Apple's zsh which is not good enough to support \dhl{git} from its
home. Github releases a \dhl{gh} command to utilize its changing
security requirements but that requires some effort to install.

The file system is usually case insensitive, meaning \dhl{Makefile} and
\dhl{makefile} are seen as the same file -- violating good software 
development. This is a system-build-time option.
