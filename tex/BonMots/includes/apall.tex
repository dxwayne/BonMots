\subsection{Apall}

Requirements: A science image (star on trace)\footnote{ 
  You can fake a dispersion across a calibration lamp image to make a crib sheet}.

The results will be an entry in the database directory with the polynomial 
parameters of how the trace defined the dispersion across the dispaxis
of the image. \index{apall!trace} \index{apall!DISPAXIS}.

The apall task is a catch all for several steps. You start
with a 'science' image, star image on a trace(s) within the
image.
