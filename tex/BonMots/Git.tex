\section{Git}

Using a Git repo to manage observing files.

Git is a 'source control management' (SCM) system. It treats a high
level directory as the root of a repository. It adds a hidden directory
\dhl{.git} to hold all its secret control mechanisms.

Github is a web/cloud service that you MAY use to manage your data.
(Dont store huge fits files!).

\begin{verbatim} 
cd ~/Observations
mkdir -p 13May2022/{usw,RawData/attic,PreReduce/attic,Reduce/atttic}
export OBSROOT=$HOME/Observations/13May2022
export OBS=$HOME/Observations/13May2022/PreReduce
cd $OBSROOT/RawData
cp <the raw data here and unzip if needed>
#etc...
\end{verbatim}
\endgroup
%% \end{Verbatim}

So cd \dhl{$HOME/Observations/13May2022} and \dhl{git init}.
Now that directory is your very own local git repository.

Now echo \dhl{'[b-z]_*fits' .git/info/exclude}.

This puts a wildcard that ignores all the temporary files
that start with the letters b thru z followed by an
underscore.
