\section{Multispec Spectra}

These images have a NAXIS of 3 or 4, where:
NAXIS1 - BAND1 reduced image
NAXIS2 - BAND2 raw image
NAXIS3 - BAND3 sky that results in reduced = raw image - sky
NAXIS4 - BAND4 variance (apall.weights = 'variance' specified.

1D spectra consist of just the BAND1 image.

When wavelength calibrated the WCS has WAT headers (values are from
a random image):

There are several keywords for headers in the spectra to be corrected:
REFSPEC1
REFSPEC2
REFSHFT1
REFSHFT2
