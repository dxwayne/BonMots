\subsection{XPA}  \label{sec:XPA}

SAOImage/DS9 supports both SAMP and XPA connections. XPA is a
superset of the ancient IIS protocol for sharing images within IRAF.
SAMP (Simple Application Messaging Protocol) shares information
between most of the important software packages, including Cartes
du Ceil, Aladin, TOPCAT etc. Aladin can find a dataset, push the
information to ds9, TOPCAT which may in turn save as a CSV or
push into a local instance of several powerful databases (PostgreSQL
and MySQL to name a few). 

From within PyRAF, commands may be chained together to open fits files
then overlay with a saved region file. This is handy for focusing
using the cimexam and jimexam commands of IRAF.

Details of the XPA services:

\selectfont
%%\begin{Verbatim} [commandchars=\\\{\}]
\begin{verbatim} 
sudo apt install xpa-tools

ps aux | grep xpans to see if a server is running.
In ds9, under File -> XPA ->Connect

Then 
xpaget xpans
DS9 ds9 gs 7f000001:34293 wayne

returns the instance of XPA program

Now we can use xpaset and xpaget to get and set parameters, command
ds9 to do things etc.

keycode summary
https://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/keyboard.html

7f000001: is local host! 128.0.0.1 sans dots and in hex

basic things:

xpaget does not use the -p switch.
xpaset needs it, unless you are piping stdin to the program


fun things:

xpaget    ds9 7f000001:37311 
xpaset -p ds9 7f000001:37311 colormap heat

Send the file in pwd to ds9:

xpaset -p ds9 file $(pwd)/Cal_15s_20240907_191138m3.fits

xpaget ds9 regions > samples.ds9

--- the file
# Region file format: DS9 version 4.1
global color=green dashlist=8 3 width=1 font="helvetica 10 normal roman" select=1 highlite=1 dash=0 fixed=0 edit=1 move=1 delete=1 include=1 source=1
physical
box(4659.5315,2603.1663,59.719672,50.761724,0)
---
Then cat sample.ds9 | xpaset ds9 regions
to force a region to that location. Decent when using imexame
across images.
