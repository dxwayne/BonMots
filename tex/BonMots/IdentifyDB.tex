IDENTIFY Database -- From the WEB

The IDENTIFY database specified by the parameter database is a
directory of simple text files. The text files have names beginning
with 'id' followed by the entry name, usually the name of the
image. The database text files consist of a number of records. A
record begins with a line starting with the keyword "begin". The rest
of the line is the record identifier. Records read and written by
identify have "identify" as the first word of the
identifier. Following this is a name which may be specified following
the ":read" or ":write" commands. If no name is specified then the
image name is used. For 1D spectra the database entry includes the
aperture number and so to read a solution from a aperture different
than the current image and aperture number must be specified. For
2D/3D images the entry name has the 1D image section which is what is
specified to read the entry. The lines following the record identifier
contain the feature information and dispersion function coefficients.

The dispersion function is saved in the database as a series of
coefficients. The section containing the coefficients starts with the
keyword "coefficients" and the number of coefficients.

The first four coefficients define the type of function, the order or
number of spline pieces, and the range of the independent variable
(the line or column coordinate along the dispersion). The first
coefficient is the function type code with values:

	Code	Type
	   1	Chebyshev polynomial
	   2	Legendre polynomial
	   3	Cubic spline
	   4	Linear spline

The second coefficient is the order (actually the number of terms) of
the polynomial or the number of pieces in the spline.

The next two coefficients are the range of the independent variable
over which the function is defined. These values are used to normalize
the input variable to the range -1 to 1 in the polynomial
functions. If the independent variable is x and the normalized
variable is n, then

	n = (2 * x - (xmax + xmin)) / (xmax - xmin)

where xmin and xmax are the two coefficients.

The spline functions divide the range into the specified number of
pieces. A spline coordinate s and the nearest integer below s, denoted
as j, are defined by

	s = (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) * npieces
	j = integer part of s
where npieces are the number of pieces.

The remaining coefficients are those for the appropriate function. The
number of coefficients is either the same as the function order for
the polynomials, npieces+1 for the linear spline, or npieces + 3 for
the cubic spline.

1. Chebyshev Polynomial

The polynomial can be expressed as the sum

	y = sum from i=1 to order {c_i * z_i}
where the the c_i are the coefficients and the z_i are defined interactively as:

	z_1 = 1
	z_2 = n
	z_i = 2 * n * z_{i-1} - z_{i-2}
2. Legendre Polynomial

The polynomial can be expressed as the sum

	y = sum from i=1 to order {c_i * z_i}
where the the c_i are the coefficients and the z_i are defined interactively as:

	z_1 = 1
	z_2 = n
	z_i = ((2*i-3) * n * z_{i-1} - (i-2) * z_{i-2}) / (i-1)
3. Linear Spline

The linear spline is evaluated as

	y = c_j * a + c_{j+1} * b

where j is as defined earlier and a and b are fractional difference
between s and the nearest integers above and below

	a = (j + 1) - s
	b = s - j
4. Cubic Spline

The cubic spline is evaluated as

	y = sum from i=0 to 3 {c_{i+j} * z_i}

where j is as defined earlier. The term z_i are computed from a and b,
as defined earlier, as follows

	z_0 = a**3
	z_1 = 1 + 3 * a * (1 + a * b)
	z_2 = 1 + 3 * b * (1 + a * b)
	z_3 = b**3

\section{Identify Example Output}

From a FlexSpec Kzin Calibration Unit: NeAr bulbs from fluorescence
lighting ballasts.

A header line was added to this example marked ``WG Added.''. There
are 3 numbers unaccounted for with questin marks.

Using a spline3 function, order 1. Fit is not that great, reported overall
residual of approx 1.2.
