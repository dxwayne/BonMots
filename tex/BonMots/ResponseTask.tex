\section{IRAF Response Task}

The twodspec.longslit.response task \index{IRAF!response task} takes a flat
image and helps to normalize a raw 2D spectrum to be flat across the trace.



\subsection{Fitting and Analysis}

The choice of function (spline1,spline3, legendre, chebyshev) and order has
a material impact on flat corrections. During the interactive phase,
the ``graphics key'' can be changed.

g	Redefine graph keys.  Any of the following data types may be along
	either axis.
	    x  Independent variable	y  Dependent variable
	    f  Fitted value		r  Residual (y - f)
	    d  Ratio (y / f)		n  Nonlinear part of y

h-l	Graph keys.  Defaults are h=(x,y), i=(y,x), j=(x,r), k=(x,d), l=(x,n)

The graphic keys (h,i,j,k,l) can be \dhl{repurposed} with the following
few keystrokes:

\llbox{g}  \llbox{i} \llbox{x} \llbox{,} \llbox{f} \\llbox{CR}

will now render the graph to show fitted value by x.
